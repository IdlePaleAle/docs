## Introducing OctoFi

OctoFi is a next generation open source platform for aggregating thousands of investment opportunities, and interfacing with decentralized finance <s>oracles</s> tentacles ‚Äî incentivised data oracle aggregators kept honest by the community. 

We believe that the term ‚Äòoracle‚Äô itself implies unreasonable dependence on a single source of truth. In most cases an oracle is viewed as singular, and while we appreciate their importance we foresee the existence of many, all of which are auditable against one another. 

Within the DeFi world, individuals shall act as proxies to an aggregation of oracular data sources, in order to optimize their own participation and interaction with an ever expanding landscape of protocols. 

OctoFi users will benefit from an ‚Äòoctomized‚Äô structure whereby 'tentacles' connect them with various applications, while leveraging truly open and transparent infrastructure. Stakeholders will play an important role in data validation while pioneering a new frontier of community governance for long term, sustainable adaptability.
