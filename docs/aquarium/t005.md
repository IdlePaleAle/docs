# Transparency Report 004

We want to keep going with our aquarium transparency reports in an effort to provide full transparency for the actions of OctoFi. 

Since the token deployment, we are providing the following comprehensive details on token holdings and use of tokens to date. We also provide transparency reports on a monthly basis.

## Summary

Update regarding locking of liquidity pool tokens:

- We made a mistake in rush, putting the wrong (too early) unix timestamp into the contract fields 
- Luckily someone inside the community told us, as we assumed we'd implemented correctly, and hadn't re-checked the timestamp
- Don't trust, verify... [team.finance page](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x7240aC91f01233BaAf8b064248E80feaA5912BA3?name=Octo.fi&symbol=OCTO)

We have executed the following steps:

### 1. Withdrew the LP pairs:

- [OCTO / USDC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9c8c2b731982bf50f3e3392c67feb836c7a1cc5a358da0c43680bcbebecde0ca)
- [OCTO / ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x55dff4582036ca59af465bbceeac6663a70ce5dea31f94ea4d335456d62632a7)
	
**Result:** Proof its possible to withdraw the funds after locking period ends and its not possible for the team.finance team to steal funds after locking period ends. 

### 2. Locked both LP pairs again for 1 year

- [OCTO / USDC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8c07b2a69319ce147f1ace23a51df63c7cbad9a3415b96374382c64894b6bc08
) locked until 12/12/2021 @ 12:00am (UTC)

- [OCTO / ETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3fc3d35d4192de434f43c6a8785efb4b85a0f35e417e53d5d21d7a92ece006b6) locked until 12/12/2021 @ 12:00am (UTC)

## Overall conclusion

- Never trust and always verify
- Thanks to our community as with your feedback you help us to improve and make us stronger 
- Team.Finance contracts are safe and audited, we verified again the security of our funds 

The results are reflected on our [team.finance page](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x7240aC91f01233BaAf8b064248E80feaA5912BA3?name=Octo.fi&symbol=OCTO). You can also verify for yourself on-chain, as with smart contracts everything is possible to verify.

## How to verify on-chain

### 1. Go to contract

Visit [etherscan.io/address/0xdbf7...220a#readContract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdbf72370021babafbceb05ab10f99ad275c6220a#readContract) and scroll down to "5. getDepositDetails" to paste each query id shown below.

### 2. Verify OCTO / ETH Pair  

- Query id: `288`

### 3. Verify OCTO / USDC Pair

- Query id: `289`

### 4. Verify 200,000 OCTO 

- Query id: `46`

Please note: To convert the unlock time from unix timestamp (eg. 1634558400) simply copy and paste into a unix time converter like this one: [unixtimestamp.com/index.php](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php)
