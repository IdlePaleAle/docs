# Transparency Report 004

We want to keep going with our aquarium transparency reports in an effort to provide full transparency for the actions of OctoFi. 

Since the token deployment, we are providing the following comprehensive details on token holdings and use of tokens to date. We will also provide transparency reports on a monthly basis going forward.

Nothing has changed regarding our recap in [Transparency Report 003](/docs/aquarium/t003/) but we improved the overall transparency and trust with a lock of the project reserve and Uniswap liquidity \#WarOnRugs, after a successful community vote on [OIP-9 (Lock Project Reserve)](https://snapshot.page/#/octofi/proposal/QmS5eSLxrPa8XjihaPwYLXvy8BGBf7UrbXsK2UujdrrUrL).

**We have executed the following steps:**

1. [Buy 1 ETH for 366 USDC](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x96cd3d32ae1e546fdf67e1520ebfed10012d03a6ffc1a8a1a81594b31f12c8cb) (Pay for gas)  
2. [Locked 200000 OCTO for 1 year](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8f68ec1d2a52e331236d3aa84a8e9fac1286863014ca314d89e14c5beb5a58f1) until 18.10.2021 12pm UTC
	2. [3rd Party audit proof and 100% smart contract based solution](https://team.finance/view-coin/0x7240aC91f01233BaAf8b064248E80feaA5912BA3?name=Octo.fi&symbol=OCTO)
3. [Streamed 25000 OCTO over 6 months](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa2ad62c6a4a05d48327fdf53167be7684d83fd296f28daff2e4354703ebd928e) back into the project reserve
	3. [Real-time funds streaming dashboard](https://app.sablier.finance/stream/867)
4. [Locking of Uniswap liquidity USDC / OCTO](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9c8c2b731982bf50f3e3392c67feb836c7a1cc5a358da0c43680bcbebecde0ca) for 1 year until 18.10.2021 12pm UTC
	4. [OIP-4 adding of Uniswap liquidity](https://snapshot.page/#/octofi/proposal/QmUTqc1mXiVkZ4xTnJCBK3ExNHwQkxCZGrkx5D9EA83iBZ)
5. [Locking of Uniswap liquidity ETH / OCTO](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x55dff4582036ca59af465bbceeac6663a70ce5dea31f94ea4d335456d62632a7) for 1 year until 18.10.2021 12pm UTC
	5. [OIP-5 Adding of Uniswap liquidity](https://snapshot.page/#/octofi/proposal/QmRGRQVzWDRcLq32hL6n41n8UJqJu7w1DS5H6wuH1duPnh)
6. [$2500 USD paid with 295 OCTO](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbf4d8905f9b7e7f3310bbc68abf7dc6c639576d8aec97177bae394476d832c65) from project funds
	6. [OIP-8 Coin Report from Nik Patel](https://snapshot.page/#/octofi/proposal/QmQZepxr99SYbKypx1azdEQkYNegmTPa5gPL7hzNRUoD1V)

You will notice that there is still one big holding of 199314 OCTO which belongs to the community as well in address  [0xb51d...35c0](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb51d93791e19d8cf1fdf1851aa97e7695a9135c0).

This is allocated to yield contract split evenly between runtime payouts and airdrop rewards [as explained in Interest Program details here](/docs/aquafarm/interest-program/). 

We will use the OCTO for our incentive program coming up as part of Octobase and the community will decide through another OIP.

Community governance is a major focus for the OctoFi project and as such we will be encouraging proposals and voting.

We are here to stay.

Warm regards, 

Dr. Octavius
