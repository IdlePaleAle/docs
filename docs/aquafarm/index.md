Track your DeFi portfolio, find new investment opportunities, buy and sell directly, and in future, interface with the [Tentacles project](/docs/tentacles/). 

Please note, Aquafarm is completely open source and is a work in progress. We invite you to follow along as we 'work in public' on its rollout.

If you are looking for the Interest Program, find the [full details here](/docs/aquafarm/interest-program/).
